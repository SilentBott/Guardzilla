# Guardzilla
 Hi, its simple bot for Codezilla discord server.

# things you MUST to edit before you run the app
 make: `bot_admin.json` file and make it like that:

    {"Admins": ["id1", "id2"]}

make env variables like that

     "TOKEN": "yourtoken"
     "mongoDBclient": "mongodb+srv://(name):(pass)@cluster0.o0xc5.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

   
  make sure to change `id1`, `id2` to the admins of the bot.

  change `(name)`, `(pass)` to the `name` and `pass` of your mongoDB
